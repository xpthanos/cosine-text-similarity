COSINE SIMILARITY ON TEXT - EXERCISE
--------------------------------------------

### INSTRUCTIONS FOR EXECUTING THE PROGRAM

1) Prior to execution, make sure Python version 3 or
newer is installed on your system.

2) The python packages "numpy" and "nltk" will also
need to be installed.

If these are not installed on your system, you can
install them using the following commands:

	$ pip install numpy
	$ pip install nltk

3) In the repository you will find the folder "files"
which contains a collection of greek poet's Cavafy
works translated in English as a sample for testing
the similarity comparison. (The file "titles.txt"
refers to the sample files and is there just for
reference for those who are interested)

If you would like to input your own files for
comparison, please make sure that they are placed
inside the folder "files".

### HOW IT WORKS

Upon execution the user can select if the words
{the, a, and} should be excluded from the similarity
comparison.

Then the program offers a list of document pairs
descending by similarity. The user can select to
view the n most similar pairs, as well as the
similarity percentage.
