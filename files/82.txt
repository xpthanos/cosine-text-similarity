One monotonous day follows another
equally monotonous. The same things
will happen again, and then will happen again,
the same moments will come and go.

 A month passes by and brings another month.
Easy to guess what lies ahead:
all of yesterday’s boredom.
And tomorrow ends up no longer like tomorrow.
