While looking at a half-gray opal
I remembered two lovely gray eyes—
it must be twenty years ago I saw them...

 ........................................

 We were lovers for a month.
Then he went away to work, I think in Smyrna,
and we never met again.

 Those gray eyes will have lost their beauty—if he’s still alive;
that lovely face will have spoiled.

 Memory, keep them the way they were.
And, memory, whatever of that love you can bring back,
whatever you can, bring back tonight.
