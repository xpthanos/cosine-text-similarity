The things he timidly imagined as a schoolboy
are openly revealed to him now. And he wanders around,
stays out all night, gets involved. And as is right (for our kind of art)
his blood—fresh and hot—
is relished by sensual pleasure. His body is overcome
by forbidden erotic ecstasy; and his young limbs
give in to it completely.
In this way a simple boy
becomes something worth our looking at, for a moment
he too passes through the exalted World of Poetry,
the young sensualist with blood fresh and hot. ﻿
