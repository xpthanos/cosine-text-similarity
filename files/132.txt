Brave men were you who fought and died so nobly,
never afraid of those who were winning every battle.
You were not to blame if Diaios and Kritolaos were at fault.
When Greeks are in a mood to boast, they’ll say
“It is men like those our nation breeds.”
That’s how great their praise will be.
 
 
Written by an Achaian in Alexandria
during the seventh year of Ptolemy Lathyros’ reign.
