Hasty and awkward creatures of the moment,
it is we who interrupt the action of the gods.
In the palaces of Eleusis and Phthia
Demeter and Thetis initiate rituals
over high flames and heavy smoke.
But Metaneira always bursts in
from the royal quarters, hair loose, terrified,
and Peleus, scared, always intervenes.
