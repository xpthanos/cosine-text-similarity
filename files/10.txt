Apollonios was speaking about
proper education and upbringing
with a young man building a luxury house in Rhodes.
“When I enter a temple,”
said the Tyanian in conclusion, “even if it is a small one,
I would much rather see
a gold and ivory statue there
than find in a large temple a statue of common clay.”
 
 
“Of common clay”: how disgusting—
yet some (who haven’t been adequately trained)
are taken in by what’s bogus. Those of common clay.
