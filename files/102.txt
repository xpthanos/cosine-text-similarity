My kind old father
whose love for me has always stayed the same—
I mourn my kind old father
who died two days ago, just before dawn.
Christ Jesus, I try each day
in my every thought, word, and deed
to keep the commandments
of your most holy Church; and I abhor
all who deny you. But now I mourn:
I grieve, O Christ, for my father
even though he was—terrible as it is to say it—
priest at that cursed Serapeion.
