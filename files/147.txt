Voices, loved and idealized,
of those who have died, or of those
lost for us like the dead.
 
Sometimes they speak to us in dreams;
sometimes deep in thought the mind hears them.
 
And with their sound for a moment return
sounds from our life’s first poetry—
like music at night, distant, fading away.
