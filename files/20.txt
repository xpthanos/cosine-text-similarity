For some among us there comes up a day
when either the great Yea or the great Nay
must needs be spoken. He who has the Yea

 ready within him, straightway stands revealed
and, giving it utterance, passes to his field
of self-expression. He who did not yield

 assent, never repents. If Nay or Yea
were asked again, he would repeat his Nay,
though that right word afflicts him night and day.
