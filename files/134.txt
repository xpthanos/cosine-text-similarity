One candle is enough. Its gentle light
will be more suitable, will be more gracious
when the Shades arrive, the Shades of Love.
 
One candle is enough. Tonight the room
should not have too much light. In deep reverie,
all receptiveness, and with the gentle lightâ€”
in this deep reverie I will form visions
to call up the Shades, the Shades of Love.
