He must be barely twenty-two years old—
yet I’m certain that almost that many years ago
I enjoyed the very same body.
 
It isn’t erotic fever at all.
And I’ve been in the casino for a few minutes only,
so I haven’t had time to drink a great deal.
I enjoyed that very same body.
 
And if I don’t remember where, this one lapse of memory 
            doesn’t mean a thing.
 
There, now that he’s sitting down at the next table,
I recognize every motion he makes—and under his clothes
I see again the limbs I loved, naked. ﻿
