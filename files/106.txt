Lines written by young Temethos, madly in love.
The title: “Emonidis”—the favorite
of Antiochos Epiphanis; a very handsome young man
from Samosata. But if the lines come out
ardent, full of feeling, it is because Emonidis
(belonging to that other, much older time:
the 137th year of the Greek kingdom,
maybe a bit earlier) is in the poem
merely as a name—a suitable one nevertheless.
The poem gives voice to the love Temethos feels,
a beautiful kind of love, worthy of him. We the initiated—
his intimate friends—we the initiated
know about whom those lines were written.
The unsuspecting Antiochians read simply “Emonidis.”
