Walking yesterday in an outlying neighborhood,
I went by the house
I used to go to when I was very young.
There Eros with his magnificent power
had taken hold of my body.

 And yesterday
when I walked along the old road,
the shops, the sidewalks, the stones,
walls and balconies and windows—
all were suddenly made beautiful by the spell of love:
nothing ugly was left there.

 And as I stood gazing at the door,
stood there lingering outside the house,
my whole being radiated
the sensual emotion stored up inside me.
