Vacuous Julian had the following to say
about our religious beliefs: “I read, I understood
I condemned.” He thought we’d be annihilated
by that “condemned,” the silly ass.
 
Witticisms like that don’t cut any ice with us Christians.
Our quick reply: “You read but didn’t understand;
had you understood, you wouldn’t have condemned.” ﻿
