Unknown—a stranger in Antioch—the man from Edessa
writes and writes. And at last, there,
the final canto’s done. That makes
eighty-three poems in all. But so much writing,
so much versifying, the intense strain
of phrasing in Greek, has worn the poet out,
and now everything weighs down on him.
But a thought suddenly brings him out of his dejection:
the sublime “That’s the man”
which Lucian once heard in his sleep.
