Here I’m not the Kleon famous in Alexandria
(where they’re not easily dazzled)
for my marvelous houses, my gardens,
for my horses and chariots,
for the jewels and silks I wore.
Far from it—here I’m not that Kleon:
his twenty-eight years are to be wiped out.
I’m Ignatios, lector, who came to his senses very late;
but even so, in that way I lived ten happy months
in the peace, the security of Christ. ﻿
